### Automatically added by Hedron's Bazel Compile Commands Extractor: https://github.com/hedronvision/bazel-compile-commands-extractor
# Ignore the `external` link (that is added by `bazel-compile-commands-extractor`). The link differs between macOS/Linux and Windows, so it shouldn't be checked in. The pattern must not end with a trailing `/` because it's a symlink on macOS/Linux.
